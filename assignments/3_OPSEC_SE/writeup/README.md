## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

I would pose as a bank employee and pretend that her account was has raised some alerts and that we are reaching out to improve her security. I would verify it is her by asking for her ATM pin number. I would tell her that for the future, we now require her mother's maiden name, the city she was born in and the name of her first pet for extra security. I would have her enter all this information on some made up website that simulates logging in to her bank account. This would allow me to see what browser she is using as well. 


### Part 2 (60 pts)

For fixing the weak password problem, I would recommend having a longer password with a mix of numbers and symbols. We definitely would want to avoid common passwords which can easily be bruteforced by using the rockyoutxt file for example. For example superman could become S8perM!n. They could also use password managers which help to encrypt passwords or generate better passwords[1]. 
To address exposed ports, I would use a firewall. Firewalls help prevent the pread of unwanted or malicious data[2].
For the publicly available robot.txt file, I would suggest making a PGP protected file. PGP allows users to encrypt files [3].
