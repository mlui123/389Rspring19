## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the [ELMS assignment](). (we'll post an announcement when this is ready!)

### Part 2 (75 pts)

<<<<<<< HEAD

If I was a junior developer who found that the current ECU firmware has several complex security problems, the first person I would go to would be my boss. It would be bad to hide a problem that could have major consequences. Additionally, my boss would probably have more experience with how to go about this situation properly. If the unsafe ECU firmware is already in production, I believe occupants have a moral right to be aware of the situation if they could be put in danger because of the security problems.

Assuming the ECU has not been released and the company is unwilling to postpone the ECU release, I would consider the likelihood of exploitation and the actual severity of a possible exploitation to factor in to how far I would go to stop or not to stop the ECU release. Unless the likelihood of exploitation was very low and the possible consequences were very minimal, I would feel morally obligated to try and postpone the ECU release.

The company may try to fight back and say they will lose lots of money if it is not released soon, but that is only looking at the problem from an economic standpoint. When you are directly responsible for ensuring the safety and well being of the customers who use your products, you hold the responsibility and obligation to protect the customers’ interests. I am sure building a solid relationship with customers will ultimately make the company more money in the long run even if they may lose some now.

At the end, if I felt very strongly against the releasing of the ECU and the company was unwilling to postpone the ECU release, I would have second thoughts about continuing to work for this company. I probably would not have the legal right to leak the ECU problems to the public, so it would probably not be worth it to do so. 

If I were to do nothing, I would feel responsible for any harm that results. Most likely I would not be held responsible for the situation from management’s perspective since it is unlikely that the junior developer would be blamed especially if the higher ups were the ones who decided not to postpone even with all the evidence presented in front of them.
