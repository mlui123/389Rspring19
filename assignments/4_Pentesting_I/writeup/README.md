## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

After reading the given website, I did ```1337bank.money; ls``` after running nc 1337bank.money 1337. After seeing there was a home directory I tried ```1337bank.money; cd home; ls```. I'll admit I didn't cd into home initially. I tried other folders like usr and bin first. I probably could of used a grep looking back but I wasn't even sure if it would be in a txt file. When I ran ```1337bank.money; cd home; ls```, the  saw there was a flag.txt file after. Finally after running the command ```1337bank.money; cd home; cat flag.txt``` I found that the flag is CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_Injec7ion}. To prevent the vulnerabilities she can whitelist special characters. This well prevent the use of a semicolon like I used or command injection more generally. 

### Part 2 (60 pts)

For part 2, I used the command injection technique of proceeding my intended command with a semicolon that I leveraged in part 1. For exiting the script, I imported the sys module and just used its exit function. Printing help wasn’t too difficult either as I just printed the help commands if the user input was “help”. The most difficult parts were implementing the shell commands and pull command. For the pull command, I sent the cat command and to store the contents in a buffer and then write those contents to a new file. For the shell commands, I found it pretty tricky to keep track of the current directories and being able to properly display them in the next line correctly. To keep track of the current directory, I sent “pwd” to get the current directory after performing my command whether it be a “cd” command or something like “ls” which wouldn’t change the directory. I decided to use a global variable which I named “cur_dir” to keep track of the current directory so I could I correctly display it for the user on input for their next command.
