## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

After reading the given website, I did ```1337bank.money; ls``` after running nc 1337bank.money 1337. After seeing there was a home directory I tried ```1337bank.money; cd home; ls```. I'll admit I didn't cd into home initially. I tried other folders like usr and bin first. I probably could of used a grep looking back but I wasn't even sure if it would be in a txt file. When I ran ```1337bank.money; cd home; ls```, the  saw there was a flag.txt file after. Finally after running the command ```1337bank.money; cd home; cat flag.txt``` I found that the flag is CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_Injec7ion}. To prevent the vulnerabilities she can whitelist special characters. This well prevent the use of a semicolon like I used or command injection more generally.
